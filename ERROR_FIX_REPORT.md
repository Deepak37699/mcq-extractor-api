# MCQ Extraction API - Error Fix and Enhancement Report

## Issue Resolved
The original issue was a nested error message when PDF extraction failed:
```
"detail": "Error processing file: 400: Error reading PDF: 400: Could not extract text from PDF..."
```

## Root Cause
The PDF extraction methods were raising `HTTPException` instances, which were then caught by the main endpoint exception handlers and wrapped in another `HTTPException`, creating nested error messages.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Error Handling Refactor
- **Changed**: Modified all extraction methods to raise `ValueError` instead of `HTTPException`
- **Added**: Specific exception handling in endpoints to catch `HTTPException` and re-raise without wrapping
- **Result**: Clean, single-level error messages

### 2. PDF Extraction Improvements
- **Enhanced**: Multi-method PDF extraction with comprehensive error collection
- **Added**: Detailed error reporting showing which extraction methods failed and why
- **Improved**: OCR fallback for scanned PDFs with better error handling

### 3. Image OCR Enhancement
- **Fixed**: Image preprocessing that was degrading OCR quality
- **Changed**: From aggressive morphological operations to lighter OTSU thresholding
- **Added**: Fallback preprocessing methods for different image types
- **Result**: Much better text extraction from images

### 4. Answer Pattern Enhancement
- **Added**: Support for "Answer. B" format (period instead of colon)
- **Enhanced**: Answer detection patterns to handle various formats
- **Improved**: Regex patterns for more flexible answer matching

### 5. Code Structure Fixes
- **Fixed**: Malformed code in enhanced endpoint causing logic errors
- **Cleaned**: Duplicate and conflicting file type handling
- **Standardized**: Error handling across both endpoints

## Test Results

### ✅ All Tests Passing
1. **Text File Extraction**: 2 questions found
2. **Image File Extraction**: 1 question with answer found 
3. **PDF Error Handling**: Clean error messages (no nesting)
4. **Unsupported File Types**: Proper error responses
5. **Enhanced Endpoint**: Full functionality with detailed analysis

### Before vs After Error Messages

**Before (Nested Error):**
```json
{
  "detail": "Error processing file: 400: Error reading PDF: 400: Could not extract text from PDF. It may be corrupted, protected, or contain only images."
}
```

**After (Clean Error):**
```json
{
  "detail": "Could not extract text from PDF using any method. Errors: PyMuPDF: Failed to open stream; PyPDF2: EOF marker not found; OCR: Error processing scanned PDF with OCR: Failed to open stream. The PDF may be corrupted, protected, or contain only images."
}
```
