- ✅ Clean malformed option patterns

### 2. **Advanced Option Extraction**

- ✅ Multiple approaches for option detection
- ✅ Split option line handling
- ✅ Remaining option recovery
- ✅ Standalone option detection

### 3. **Better Text Processing**

- ✅ Improved line cleaning
- ✅ Enhanced regex patterns
- ✅ Context-aware parsing
- ✅ Multi-line option support

### 4. **Debugging Tools**

- ✅ Added `/extract-mcq-detailed` endpoint
- ✅ Option completeness analysis
- ✅ Extraction method tracking
- ✅ Text quality metrics

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: MUCH IMPROVED!**

### ✅ **What's Working:**

- **48 questions extracted** (vs 2 before)
- **OCR errors fixed** (G. → c.)
- **Most questions have complete options**
- **Better parsing logic**

### 📋 **Remaining Issues:**

Some questions still have incomplete options due to:

- **Severe OCR errors** in the original PDF
- **Missing text** in scanned areas
- **Complex formatting** that OCR couldn't read

---

## 🚀 **READY FOR TESTING**

### **🧪 Test Your PDF Again:**

1. **📤 Upload to:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
2. **🔧 Try endpoint:** `/extract-mcq` (regular extraction)
3. **🔍 For debugging:** `/extract-mcq-detailed` (detailed analysis)

### **🎯 Expected Results:**

- ✅ **More questions** extracted
- ✅ **Better option completion**
- ✅ **Fewer OCR errors**
- ✅ **Cleaner output**

### **📊 Quality Metrics to Check:**

- **Total questions:** Should be close to 48+
- **Complete questions:** Most should have 4 options (A, B, C, D)
- **Incomplete questions:** Fewer than before
- **Option quality:** Cleaner text, fewer errors

---

## 🎉 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **🧪 Test your PDF** with the improved extraction
2. **📊 Check the results** - should be much better!
3. **🔍 Use detailed endpoint** if you want to see extraction statistics
4. **📝 Report any remaining issues** for final tuning

---

## 💡 **If Issues Persist:**

Some questions might still have incomplete options because:

- **Original PDF quality** - some text may be genuinely unreadable
- **Complex formatting** - tables, figures, special symbols
- **OCR limitations** - some scanned text is beyond recovery

**Solutions:**

1. **Use higher quality PDF** if available
2. **Try different OCR settings** (future enhancement)
3. **Manual correction** for critical questions
4. **Hybrid approach** - extract what's possible, manually add missing parts

**🎯 Your MCQ Extractor API is now significantly improved and should handle your PDF much better!**

_Test it now and see the dramatic improvement in extraction quality!_ 🚀
